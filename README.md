User interface for communicating with a 'BoeBot', an autonomously guidable vehicle that can traverse flat surfaces. The user interface is mainly responsible for bidirectional communication between the UI and our [custom-written BoeBot controller software](https://github.com/simonavans/BoeBotManager). This was a group assignment for the AGV course of Computer Science (Avans University of Applied Sciences).

Using a shortest path algorithm, it can navigate the BoeBot correctly over a grid-like surface. A user can input coordinates to the UI where obstacles or grabbable objects may be located. The robot can put any grabbable object down on a desired location. The user interface will show a live graphical view of the BoeBot's state and location.
